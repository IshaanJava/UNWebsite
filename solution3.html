        <p>40% of Afghans face food insecurity. This means that 16 million people are at risk of starvation at some point in their daily lives. Afghanistan's war-torn history has led its citizens down a path of poverty and devastation. Almost half of the country lives below the poverty line, and as a result, they are not able to provide for themselves and their families. This leads to millions of families going hungry every day.

        <p>Environmental issues make an already pressing issue all the more dangerous. The country is especially mountainous and rainfall is scarce in most places. These factors increase the risks of hunger exponentially in Afghanistan, due to farming becoming an ever-challenging occupation. This is compounded by the changing climate, which leads to an arid country becoming increasingly more unfarmable. Taking action on this dire issue can provide immediate relief to millions. <a href="https://www.wfpusa.org/countries/afghanistan/
